I am by no means a rocket scientist and don't claim to be, however, I do find the stage 1 falcon 9 rocket re-entry and landing fascinating. Pondering how this great engineering feat is posible keeps me on my toes. Using knowledge that is readily available to me and what I am learning I will attempt to pseudocode and basic re-entry of the Falcon 9 rocket. I would love to one day experiment and attempt a calculated re-entry of a MODEL rocket using my software developing skills. # pseudocodeFalcon
