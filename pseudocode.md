# Falcon 9 re-entry and landing
## Falcon 9 specs
The Falcon 9 rocket consists of two stages. Stage 1 propels the rocket almost into orbit and detaches and then returns to a landing drone "safely". the stage 1 rocket has nine engines that help guide the rocket back down to earh along with other functions:
* reposition rocket vertically after seperation
    * uses nitrogen (cold gas) thrusters to flip over the rocket so that it is head up
        * Uses thrusters to keep attitude vertical
* Uses rocket fuel leftover to burn after it is vertical to slow speeds and keep rocket from burning up as it returns to earth
* deploys grid fins which assist in guiding the rocket without using all reserved fuel
* activates final landing burn which slows rocket down to 20 km/h
* deploys three carbon fiber landing legs to help absorb impact and stabilize rocket on the ground

## Program Falcon 9
'''

Functions: 
INIT cold gas thrusters // to upright and stabalize rocket 
INIT Airspeed indicators // to determine airspeed used for gridfins, thrusters, and burns 
INIT Groundspeed indicators // to indicate how fast rocket is moving along the ground to compare to droneship movement 
INIT GPS // Calculate and communicate positions
INIT Thrust // to assist rocket guidance

START(MECO (Main engine cut-off) and seperation of stage 1 rocket)

READ; rocket(x,y) // reads horizontal and vertical position of rocket

INIT(rocketthruster) UNTIL(x,y)=(0,y)
IF(rocket)=vert THEN(deploygridfins) // to guide
    not INIT(rocketthruster) UNTIL(x,y)=(0,y) 
WHILE(rocketthruster) = true THEN(INIT(GPS))
    IF(vert) THEN deploy gridfins

END(seperation and restabalizing)
    

DISPLAY(x,y axis of rocket to Droneship)

INIT(airspeed &amp; groundspeed indicactors)

CALCULATE(position and speed for re-entry) 
    IF(speed=4700) THEN(activate re-entry burn to slow speeds)
        NOT(continue calcute speed) 
    ENDIF
IF(re-entry burn successfull) THEN(send droneship position)
    NOT successful READ position

END(re-entry sequence)


START(Desecent of stage 1 rocket)

READ(Speed &amp; locations)

CALCULATE(distance &amp; attitude)

IF(attâ‰ vert) THEN(INIT(thruster))
    ELSE INIT gridfins
INPUT position
CASE 
    vert: INIT gridfins 
    non-vert: INIT thrusters to increment/ decrement x value to 0 
ENDCASE 

START(Final landing sequence)
CALCULATE(altitude) // calculates difference in altitude from droneship to rocket
